    "For this assignment, you will design and implement a number of classes to represent individuals moving through a theme park. The theme park will be modelled as a network of queues. Each queue represents a ride within the theme park. You will then use these classes to simulate activity within a theme park, whereby customers queue for rides before moving onto a different ride or leaving the park. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each person visiting the theme park will be represented as a new `Customer` object. This will contain important information about each individual person and the time they spend at different rides in the park. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each ride should be represented by a `Ride` object. Each ride has a `ride_rate` which governs the distribution of the time the customer spends on the ride once they reach . This time will vary for each customer and should be modelled as an exponential random variable. \n",

    "To simulate your theme park, you will need to make use of a priority queue. A priority queue a type of queue that arranges its elements based on their priority value. For our theme park, the priority values will correspond to the times at which the next customer will be processed. We will use this to determine which 'event' should be processed next in the simulation. An 'event' corresponds either to a new customer arriving in the theme park, or a customer being carried by a ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `PriorityQueue` should have a single attribute called `queue`, which you should initialise to be an empty list. This will contain tuples of the form `(event_time, rideID)`, where `event_time` is the priority value, `rideID` is a unique identifier corresponding to the ride. Note that a `rideID` of 0 corresponds to a new customer arriving in the theme park.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your class should have two methods\n",
    "- `push`: insert a new event into `queue`\n",
    "- `popleft`: remove and return the first item in `queue`, i.e. the one with the smallest `event_time`. This should raise an `IndexError` with an appropriate message if `queue` is empty.\n"

    "\n",
    "- `rides`: an ordered collection of `Ride` instances. You can assume that these are provided in increasing order of `ride_id`. \n",
    "- `arrival_rate`: the arrival rate of customers into the theme park, modelled as an exponential random variable\n",
    "- `transition_matrix`: a $(q + 2) \\times (q + 2)$ `numpy` array containing the probabilities of moving from one ride to another, where $q$ is the number of rides in the theme park. The first *row* contains the probabilities that a customer starts a particular ride on arrival into the theme park. For example, `transition_matrix[0,2]` contains the probability that a customer goes to the 2nd ride first. The last *column* contains the probability that a customer exits the theme park after being processed by a particular ride. For example, `transition_matrix[3,q+1]` contains the probability that a customer leaves the park after being processed by the 3rd ride.\n",
    "- `event_queue`: a `PriorityQueue` (Task 1) indicating the sequence of events (i.e. a customer arriving or a customer being processed by a ride) next to take place.\n",
    "- `customers`: a list, initialised to be empty, which keeps track of the `Customer` instances that have passed through the theme park.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `route_customer`: this method should take as input the `ride_id` of the current ride and determines the next ride based on the probabilities in the `transition_matrix`.\n",
    "- `simulate`: this method should perform a simulation of customers arriving and moving through the theme park. It should handle the flow of events by:\n",
    "    - Processing new customer arrivals and directing them to rides using  `route_customer`.\n",
    "\t- Managing the processing of customers at each ride and determining their next ride using `route_customer`.\n",
    "\t- Maintaining the simulation time and ensuring events are handled in the correct order using the priority queue (event_queue).\n",
    "   The function should take as input an argument `max_time` which determines the end time of the simulation. It should also take an argument `verbose` (with default value `False`). If `verbose=True`, the method should print an appropriate statement every time a customer arrives at the theme park or is processed by a ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you should also include a method such that calling `str(obj)` where `obj` is a `ThemePark` instance prints the current status of the ride queues."

    "The Saturday and Sunday seem to be the busiest on average, with Friday slightly behind while the other weekdays seem to be less busy which we may expect for a themepark. The average number of rides taken by each customer seems to be similar for all days. The total wait times follow a similar pattern to the number of customers broadly; wait times are longer during the weekends than during the weekdays. The total ride times for Monday to Thursday are reasonably similar, while the total ride times for Friday, Saturday and Sunday are much higher, which we would expect as more customers tend to visit the themepark on Friday and the weekends.\n"

    "### Data Structures\n",
    "PriorityQueue: The PriorityQueue class has one attribute, queue, a list to allow for sorting (mutability) and ordered terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer: Attributes like path, ride_times, and wait_times use lists to be able to handle duplicates (e.g., multiple rides with the same ride or wait time) and allow updates during simulations (mutability). The order property is useful in that a single index corresponds to the same ride_id, ride_time, and wait_time of a given event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ride: Ride attributes primarily use primitive data structures, except for the deque inherited from the deque class, used for its efficiency and clarity over standard lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "ThemePark: The ride and customers attributes are lists of Ride and Customer instances due to their mutability and indexing. The transition_matrix is a numpy array for better efficiency, while event_queue is a PriorityQueue instance to ensure events occur in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: All four classes bundle related data and methods. Private attributes (eg, rate and id attributes) restrict direct access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: The Ride class inherits from the deque class, allowing us to build on existing functionality (more efficient than a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: The Ride class overrides the init method and overloads the string method, leading to additional functionality (eg, debugging). The \n",
    "function overriding lets us add additional attributes compared to the deque class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Height restrictions on rides: Introduce a height attribute for the Customer class and a height_requirement attribute for the Ride class. We could add an if statement to the route_customer function to check the customer fulfils the height requirement of the ride they are directed to, if not, we could redirect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum queue lengths: Introduce a max_queue attribute to either the Ride class (either as a class or instance attribute). We can add an if statement checking if the queue length isequal to the max_queue length. If the max_queue length has been reached, we could redirect the customer to another ride through the route_customer method based on the ride whose queue they were meant to join (else new customers could cause an infinite loop). se an infinite loop).
