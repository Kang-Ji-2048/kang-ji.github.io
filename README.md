## About me

I'm a 2nd year student at UCL studying Bsc Data Science, I have a particular interest in biostatistics and the general implementation of statistical methods in healthcare and medicine.
Outside of statistics and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks and spending time with my üêê

### Projects and fun competitions
- TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Ant algorithm, simulated annealing, Concorde) 
- MySQL Charity Database Design for Tracking SDGs 
- CanSat competition in conjunction with ESA
- Linear Analysis of Archivex physics papers
- Themepark Modelling with Python

### Learning üéì
I am currently earning about (ethical) webscraping in my free time as well as trying to bake a souffle.\
I am also trying to create a new generating function

### Skills and Qualifications

Coding languages
- Python (Machine learning, Webscraping, OOP)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling, pretty graphs :) )
- SQL (Database design, implementation and queries)
- HTML (Basic webpage design)

Statistics Side
- Multivariate linear regression 
- Stochastic processes (with a particular interest in Markov chain modelling)
- Standard 1st year statistics (Confidence intervals, generating functions, Classical and Bayesian approaches to probability)
