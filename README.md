## About me

I'm a 2nd year student at UCL studying Bsc Data Science, I really like machine learning/general algorithm approaches that either take inspiration from nature (eg the Ant algorithm) or are elegant in their simplicity (eg, MENACE). I'm also interested in the way generating functions are able to store so much information as well as their uniqueness. I am also interested in approaches/corrections for (arbritrary) decisions, such as the 5% significance level\
Outside of stats and coding, I enjoy baking, playing badminton and taking long walks and spending time with my üêê

### Projects and fun competitions (in order of value)
- TSP modelling for Badminton footwork (Ant algorithm, simulated annealing, Concorde) FILE HERE
- MySQL Charity Database Design for Tracking SDGs FILE HERE
- CanSat competition in conjunction with ESA
- Linear Analysis of Archivex physics papers
- Themepark Modelling with Python

### Learning üéì
I am currently earning about (ethical) webscraping in my free time as well as trying to bake a souffle.\
I am also trying to create a new generating function

### Skills and Qualifications

Coding languages
- Python (Machine learning, Webscraping, OOP)
- R (Modelling, data wrangling, pretty graphs :) )
- SQL (Database design, implementation and queries)
- HTML (Basic webpage design)

Statistics Side
- Multivariate linear regression 
- Stochastic processes (with a particular interest in Markov chain modelling)
- Standard 1st year statistics (Confidence intervals, generating functions, Classical and Bayesian approaches to probability)
